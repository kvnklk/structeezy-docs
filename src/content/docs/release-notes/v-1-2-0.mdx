Structeezy 1.2 is available, and brings awesome new features to help you save plenty of time when creating your structures.

- [Iconify Integration](#iconify-integration)
- [Code Parser](#code-parser)
- [Structeezy Window](#structeezy-window)

To take advantage of the latest features, make sure you’re running the latest version of Structeezy. You can upgrade to Structeezy 1.2 by running an automatic plugin update from you WordPress plugins dashboard, of by downloading the `.zip` file from your [user account](https://structeezy.com/my-account/).

## Iconify Integration

Iconify is an open source project, created to make it easy to work with different icon sets in a consistent way.

It includes over 200k icons from more than 150 open source icon sets, all cleaned up, optimised and kept up to date.

Structeezy now integrates directly with the [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) API to allow searching and inserting icons in your page structures from the iconify huge list of icon sets.

## Code Parser

The code parser is a new **big** feature that allows you to write or paste html or svg code in the Structeezy editor and have it parsed and converted to a Bricks structure.

<Image src={parser} alt="" width="900" />

Structeezy now parses SVG and HTML code and creates a Bricks structure from it you can:
- write standard html or svg code in the editor, Structeezy will parse it and create a Bricks structure from it.
- copy html or svg code from anywhere on the internet and paste it in the editor, Structeezy will parse it and create a Bricks structure from it.

### Use Emmet

To save even more time creating your structures, Structeezy Editor supports [Emmet](https://emmet.io/), a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in HTML via content assist.

<Image src={emmet} alt="" width="900" />

In the above example, we have written the following code in the Structeezy editor:

```html title="Emmet example"
(div>dl>(dt+dd)*3)+footer>p
```

Emmet first converts it to this expanded html code:

```html title="Emmet to html"
<div>
  <dl>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd></dd>
  </dl>
</div>
<footer>
  <p></p>
</footer>
```

Then Structeezy parses it and creates the corresponding Bricks structure.

## Structeezy Window

In v1.2, Structeezy window has been improved with a slightly different design and new features.

### Docking

You can now “dock” Structeezy at the bottom right of your window.

<Image src={dock} alt="" width="900" />

To dock Structeezy:
- click on the orange “Dock” button at the top left of the window.
- or use the keyboard shortcut `alt + m` (Windows) or `option + m` (Mac). You can customize the shortcut in the Structeezy settings.
