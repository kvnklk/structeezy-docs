## SVG Structure Builder

You have now access no all possible SVG elements to create shapes, masks, clippaths, filters, anything SVG can do.

Did I miss one? Let me know and I'll add it to the list.

## CSS Scroll-Driven Animations

A new pattern was added to the collection:
* *CoverFlow* - A vintage iTunes like coover flow animation.

## Random Picture

The Semantic > Embeds > Picture elements now includes a random placeholder image generation using the same Picsum API as the Random Image in structures.

## Improvements

I did refactor several elements based on my use and feedback from users to make them more flexible and easier to use with the most used attributes. 

## Other fixes

The update also includes several other fixes and performance improvements.
