To all who come to this happy place: welcome.

This is the repo for [docs.structeezy.com](https://docs.structeezy.com).
This repo contains all the source code we use to build our docs site. And if you are wondering, this docs website is built whith [Astro](https://astro.build) and the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) Astro integration.
